Read my articles for a detailed explanation.<br>
[How Transformer Works](https://medium.com/@sayedebad.777/mastering-transformer-detailed-insights-into-each-block-and-their-math-4221c6ee0076) and [Code from Scratch](https://medium.com/@sayedebad.777/mastering-transformer-detailed-insights-into-each-block-and-their-math-4221c6ee0076)

This notebook is divided into 6 parts:
**1. Libraries:** import all the necessary tools and libraries
**2. Dataset:** downlaod the dataset from Hugging Face
**3. Config:** Description of the parameters of the model.
**4. Model:** Code for the model.
**5. Training:** Train the model on the dataset.
**6. Evaluation:** Evaluate the trained model on benchmarks.
