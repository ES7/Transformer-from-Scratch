Read my articles for a detailed explanation: [How Transformer Works](https://medium.com/@sayedebad.777/mastering-transformer-detailed-insights-into-each-block-and-their-math-4221c6ee0076) and [Code from Scratch](https://medium.com/@sayedebad.777/mastering-transformer-detailed-insights-into-each-block-and-their-math-4221c6ee0076)

I have chosen the translation task (English to Italian) to train my Transformer model on the [opus_books](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Helsinki-NLP/opus_books) dataset from Hugging Face.
